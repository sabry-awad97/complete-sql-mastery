/* 
 Database concurrency is the ability of a database to allow multiple 
 users to affect multiple transactions. This is one of the main properties
 that separates a database from other forms of data storage, like spreadsheets.
 Concurrency problems:
 1. lost updates
 2. dirty reads
 3. non-repeating reads
 4. phantom reads

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'transaction_isolation';

SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;

-- only for the current session;

SET GLOBAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;

-- set it globally;

-- ISOLATION LEVELS --

-- 1. READ UNCOMMITTED - the lowest isolation level with all concurrency problems;

-- 2. READ COMMITTED - here we don't have dirty reads, but do have unrepeatable or inconsistent reads.

-- 3. REPEATABLE READ - this is the DEFAULT isolation level in mysql, which solves most of the concurrency problems (not phantom reads);

-- 4. SERIALIZABLE - solves all concurrency problems, but has more locks, recourses which can hurt performances and reliability.
